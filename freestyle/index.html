    <h1>KIWI</h1>
    <h2>Kiwi Origin</h2>
      <p><em>The original fruit is from the Far East, having been grown in what is now modern-day China for many centuries. It was only at the turn of the 20th Century, in 1904, that it arrived on New Zealand shores, when New Zealand school principal Isabel Fraser brought some kiwifruit seeds back from her travels.
        Being of Chinese origin, kiwifruit originally had a Chinese name, yang tao. But when the fruit was first grown in New Zealand, their sweet/sharp flavour and green colour quickly earned them the nickname ‘Chinese Gooseberries.’ Gooseberries not being the most popular fruit, in 1959 it was decided to change the name to kiwifruit, after New Zealand’s national bird. Not many fruits are named after animals but, setting them side by side, they are both small, brown and fuzzy! </p> </em>
